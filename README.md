# portfolio-react

I'm glad that I was able to create as many components as I did with this. It is a bit disappointing to not have my background working, but I'll keep trying to figure out what I'm missing. I think it's a styling issue, but I'm not 100% sure on that. 

I'd also like the project card to look a bit better.
